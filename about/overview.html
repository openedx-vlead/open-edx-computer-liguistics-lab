  <h2>About This Course</h2>
  <p>The objective of Computational Linguistics lab is to re-orient students of linguistics to the computational aspects of language analysis. At the same time, students coming from backgrounds other than linguistics will be introduced to linguistic concepts, terminology and analysis..</p>

  <p>Computational linguistics is an interdisciplinary study drawing inputs mainly from computer science and linguistics. Linguistics is the scientific study of human language. The subfields of linguistics include Phonology, Morphology, Syntax, Semantics, Discourse and Pragmatics. In computational linguistics, all these subfields are modeled computationally for analysis and generation of language. In the first phase of the virtual labs, however, learners are exposed to only two levels of language processing – word and sentence levels.</p>
