<h4>Definition</h4>
<br /> <b>Tokens</b> correspond to the total number of word counts in a text while <b>type</b> corresponds to the total count of unique words in a text. We can say that language consists of various types of words and all the particular instances of these words are called tokens. <br /><br /> For Eg: Do not waste time as wasting time does a lot of harm. <br /><br /> Here, <br /> #tokens=12 <br /> #types=11 (time has been repeated twice) <br /><br />
<h4>Type vs token distinction</h4>
The type/token distinction is related to that between universals and particulars. Tokens are concrete particular instances of a general and abstract type.<br /> There is only one word 'the' (type) but many instances of it found on this page (token). <br /><br /> The type/token distinction is applicable beyond language as well. <br /> For eg:
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Beethoven&rsquo;s Fifth Symphony and performances of it</li>
<li>the white elephant and specimens of it</li>
<li>Kentucky Fried Chicken and its centres</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h4>Types - (continued)</h4>
<ul>
<ul>Study this example again: Do not waste time as wasting time does a lot of harm.</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>Now, we notice that 'waste' and 'wasting' share a common root. So do 'do' and 'does'.</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>Do we consider them as different types? The second approach is to consider them as a single type as inflections(different grammatical forms) of the same word (type).</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>Therefore,</ul>
</ul>
<ul>#tokens=12 #types(root)=9</ul>
