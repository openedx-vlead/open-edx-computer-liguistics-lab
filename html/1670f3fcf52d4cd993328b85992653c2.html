<p style="font-size: 15px;"><b><u style="font-size: 17px;">Clause</u></b><br /> A clause typically contains a subject noun phrase and a finite verb. Some languages allow subjects to be omitted. There are two types of subclauses:</p>
<ol>
<li>independent clause</li>
<li>subordinate clause</li>
</ol>
<p>Independent clause shows the complete meaning in it. For example: Ram eats. A subordinate clause is not a complete sentence. For example: because I am sick. Sentences can also be classified on the basis of clauses.<br /><br /> Classification on the basis of clauses are:</p>
<ol>
<li>A <b>simple sentence</b> consists of only one independent clause. There are no subordinate clauses.</li>
<li>A <b>compound sentence</b> consists of more than one independent clauses joined ny conjunctions or punctuations. There are no subordinate clauses.</li>
<li>A <b>complex sentence</b> consists of atleast one indpendent clause and a single subordinate clause</li>
<li>A <b>complex-compoundssentence</b> consists of more than one independent clauses and atleast one of the independent clauses has one or more than one subordinate clauses</li>
